    <h2>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
    <p>
JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration,
 while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,
<pre>
      Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, 
      and same characters in corresponding positions.
      Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value. 
      There are two special cases in this, i. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. 
      ii. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
      Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
      Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
      Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e, null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true</pre></p>
    <h2>2.What is the spread operator?</h2>
    <p>
The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
<pre>example : let arr=["i","am","rohit"] 
let arr2 =["hey","hi"];
let arr1 = [...arr,...arr2]
console.log(arr1);</pre></p
    >
    <h2>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var,
      let, and const. var keyword is oldest keyword and let and const are
      introduced in es6. • var declarations are globally scoped or function
      scoped while let and const are block scoped. • var variables can be
      updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but
      not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. •
      They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables
      are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not
      initialized. • While var and let can be declared without being
      initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
    </p>
    <h2>4.what is execution context ?</h2>
    <pre>When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
      Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
      The creation phase:
      When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context.
      The execution phase :
      During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.
      example : var a=10;
  console.log(a); </pre>
  <h2>5.What is meant by first class functions</h2>
  <pre>In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. 
    For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener
    
    const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
    document.addEventListener("click", handler);</pre>
    <h2>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</h2>
    <pre>A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
      i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains. 
      i. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets ii. Outer function’s variables iii. Global variables.
      function Welcome(name) {
        var greetingInfo = function (message) {
          console.log(message + " " + name);
        };
        return greetingInfo;
      }
      var myFunction = Welcome("John");
      myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
      myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
      As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.</pre>
     <h2>7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h2>
     <pre>These are just different way of calling or invoking a function.
      when you are calling a function using any of these then you Document
      have to define in the function that the first argument will be an object.

      example: let user1 = {
          name : 'rahul',
          age : 23,
          city :'tirupati'
      }
      let user2 = {
          name : 'Govindh',
          age : 24,
          city :'chittoor'
      }
      function Userdetail(company,designation){
          console.log(this.name + 'is' + this.age + 'years old',company," ",designation)
      }
      Userdetail.call(user1,"google","front end dev")//call:Argument will be passed individually.//
      Userdetail.apply(user2,"hcl","back end dev")//Apply : Argument will be passed in an array.//

      const newFunction = Userdetail.bind(user1);//Bind: It will return you new function,you can use it anywhere.
      newFunction("Flipkart","Full stack");</pre>
