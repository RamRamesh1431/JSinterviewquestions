    <h2>1.What is creation phase and execution phase?</h2>
    <b>creation phase</b>
    <p>
      In the creation phase, the Execution Context is first associated with an
      Execution Context Object (ECO). The Execution Context Object stores a lot
      of important data which the code in the Execution Context uses during its
      run-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation phase occurs in 3 stages, during which the properties of the
      Execution Context Object are defined and set. These stages are:
    </p>
    <pre>
Creation of the Variable Object (VO)
      Creation of the Scope Chain
      Setting the value of the this keyword</pre
    >
    <b>Execution Phase</b>
    <p>
      Finally, right after the creation phase of an Execution Context comes the
      execution phase. This is the stage where the actual code execution begins.
      Up until this point, the VO contained variables with the values of
      undefined. If the code is run at this point it is bound to return errors,
      as we can't work with undefined values. At this stage, the JavaScript
      engine reads the code in the current Execution Context once more, then
      updates the VO with the actual values of these variables. Then the code is
      parsed by a parser, gets transpired to executable byte code, and finally
      gets executed.
    </p>
    <h2>2.What are objects in javascript?</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a
      collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name
      (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case
      the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are
      predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter
      describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how
      to create your own objects.
    </p>
    <h2>3.What are function constructors?</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, a constructor function is used to create objects.</p>
    <pre>
// constructor function
      function Person () {
          this.name = 'John',
          this.age = 23
      }
      
      // create an object
      const person = new Person();</pre
    >
    <p>
      In the above example, function Person() is an object constructor function.
      To create an object from a constructor function, we use the new keyword.
    </p>
    <h2>4.Explain prototypes</h2>
    <p>
      Prototype:: An object's prototype ,object may also have a prototype
      object, which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on. This is
      often referred to as a prototype chain, and explains why different objects
      have properties and methods defined on other objects available to them.
      function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) { this.firstName = first;
      this.lastName = last; this.age = age; this.eyeColor = eyecolor; }
    </p>
    <pre>
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
      const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
      console.log(myFather);
      console.log(myMother);
      //in case, if you want to add other properties in the object created using function constructor.
      
      myFather.age = 49;
      console.log(myFather);
      //in case when you want to add properties inside the function constructor.
      
      Person.prototype.City = "Vizag";
      myFather.City = "Vijaywada";
      console.log(myFather.City);</pre
    >
    <h2>5.What is prototype chain</h2>
    <pre>
 It is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

      The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or proto property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype.

    <h2>6.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h2>
    <pre>
  function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.gender = gender;
      this.id = id;
  };

  function Developer(name, age, gender, id, 
  specialization) {

      // Calling Employee constructor function
      Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);

      // Adding a new parameter
      this.specialization = specialization;
  }
  console.log(Employee.prototype);
  console.log(Developer.prototype);</pre

    <h2>7.What are callbacks?</h2>
    <pre>
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

      function callbackFunction(name) {
        console.log("Hello " + name);
      }
      
      function outerFunction(callback) {
        let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
        callback(name);
      }
      
      outerFunction(callbackFunction);</pre
