    <h2>1.What is the use of setTimeout</h2>
    <pre>
The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Good morning");
      }, 2000);</pre

    <h2>2.What is an event loop and call stack</h2>
    <p>
      The Event Loop is a queue of callback functions. When an async function
      executes, the callback function is pushed into the queue. The JavaScript
      engine doesn't start processing the event loop until the async function
      has finished executing the code. Note: It allows Node.js to perform
      non-blocking I/O operations even though JavaScript is single-threaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Call stack is a process in JavaScript which is used to keep track of
      functions. When we call a function, JavaScript will add that function to
      the call stack. If this function invokes another function, JavaScript will
      add that function to the call stack as well, above the first function.

    <h2>3.What are arrow functions?</h2>
    <p>
      An arrow function is short function expression, used to replace with
      regular function in low complexity. Arrow functions were introduced to
      JavaScript in ES6. The intention to create arrow function is to shorten
      function code. Arrow function has its advantage and disadvanatges
      comparing with normal function.

    <pre>
var addition = (a + b) => {
      return a + b;
  }</pre

    <h2>4.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h2>
    <pre>
The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

      Let's see this behavior with an example,
      
      function somemethod() {
        console.log(counter1); // undefined
        console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
        var counter1 = 1;
        let counter2 = 2;
      }</pre

    <h2>5.What is hoisting?</h2>
    <pre>
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

      console.log(message);    //output : undefined
      var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
      The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,
      
      var message;
      console.log(message);
      message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
      In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too
      
      message("Good morning");    //Good morning
      
      function message(name) {
        console.log(name);
      }
      This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.</pre

    <h2>6.What is the DOM?</h2>
    <p>
      The Document Object Model or DOM is created by the browser when a webpage
      is loaded. In graphical form, its like a tree of elements also called
      nodes, which are used to represent every single element on the page.
    </p>
    <pre>
Some of the actions that we can perform with this model are:

      Change/Remove HTML elements in the DOM/on the page.
      
      Change and add CSS styles to elements
      
      Read and change attributes (href, src, alt), etc.
      
      Create new elements and insert them into the DOM/page.
      
      Attach event listeners to elements (click, keypress, submit)</pre

    <h2>7.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h2>
    <pre>
undefined::It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
      Type of undefined is undefined.
      The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
      Indicates absence of variable itself.
      Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations.</pre
    >
    <pre>
not defined::Where not defined is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap</pre
    >
    <pre>
NaN::The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.Not a Number, is a member of a numeric data type that can be interpreted as a value that is undefined

      isNaN("Hello"); //true isNaN("100"); //false</pre
